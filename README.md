# Reuters dataset: Model subclassing and custom training loops

__Objective__: employ model subclassing and custom training loops in Tensorflow to train a model for the Reuters dataset. 

Natural language processing and document classification

A similar code employing the Sequential API of Tensorflow can be foung in Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/drscarlat/reuters-document-classification-with-keras-tf](https://www.kaggle.com/drscarlat/reuters-document-classification-with-keras-tf)
